# finalCapstone
# _Project Name Cypher_ 
# Project Description:
The project is a Python function that implements a Caesar cipher encryption. It takes a message as input and encodes it by shifting each alphabetical character by 15 positions. Non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged. The encoded message is returned as the output.
# Importance:
The project's importance lies in demonstrating the implementation of a basic encryption algorithm. The Caesar cipher is a historical encryption technique that provides a simple way to obfuscate messages. By understanding and implementing such algorithms, you gain insight into the fundamentals of encryption and can build a foundation for more advanced cryptographic concepts.
# Functionality:
The encode_message function processes each character in the input message and applies the Caesar cipher transformation. It handles both uppercase and lowercase characters appropriately and preserves non-alphabetic characters. The encoded message allows you to share sensitive information in a manner that requires a recipient to possess the decoding logic to decipher it.
# *Overall*, this project serves as an introduction to encryption techniques and showcases the practical application of Python programming in information security.
